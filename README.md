Lab 01: Java primitives and control flow.
  The link to my solved work is https://github.com/Antberry/java-fundamentals/pull/1. I wrote three functions for Pluralizing a word, Flip a coin to get heads in a row, and getting the current time every second.

Lab 02: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists.
  I wrote four functions for Dice roll, duplicates, calulating the average of one array, and calculating the average of array of arrays and returning the array with the least average.
