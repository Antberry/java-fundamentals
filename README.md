## Lab 01: Java primitives and control flow
  The link to my solved work is https://github.com/Antberry/java-fundamentals/pull/1. I wrote three functions for Pluralizing a word, Flip a coin to get heads in a row, and getting the current time every second.

## Lab 02: Arrays, for loops, imports, ArrayLists
  I wrote four functions for Dice roll, duplicates, calulating the average of one array, and calculating the average of array of arrays and returning the array with the least average.
  
## Lab 06: Composition and Inheritance, Part 1
  I created a Restaurant class that has a Name, Number of Stars, and Price Category. Then I implemented the Restaurant Constructor and tested that it can successfully created an instance of the Restaurant Constructor. 
  I also created a Review class that has a Body, Author, and Number of stars. I implemented the Review Constructor and tested that it can successfully created an instance of the Review Constructor. 
  I written a new toString() method to override the default toString() method that all objects in Java recieve. 
  I created a addReview method on to the Restaurant Class so reviews can be added to a ArrayList and the I can calculate the Number of Stars the Restaurant have after it recieves a new review.

# Lab 09: Potent Quotables
